# Classic Sponza - Godot Remaster (?)
This is a Godot port of [Unity's remaster of the classic Sponza scene](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/Classic-Sponza) to see how well Godot can match Unity's performance and visual quality. To sum it up, Godot can match in terms of color and lighting, but with about half the performance on my setup. Lightmapping is also much lower quality in Godot.
